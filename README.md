# Virtual-Badge
This is `Virtual Badge` app as college project for `CMPE 272` made by Prashant Yadav, Prashant Luthra, Akshay Talathi and Akshay Joshi. The basic idea of this project is to make a badging system is by combining everyday usable devices with intelligent software, which can read QR code generated by the name and email-id of user.

The whole concept of it is to give user with valid access will be detected by scanning QR code generated by system after user logins to the system. We are trying to give solution to the problems of physically carrying badges all around and redundancy in existing system with duplicate badges.

## Working

#####1.	User registers into the system with login credentials.
#####2.	For the project purpose we have assigned admin rights to :
Username – admin@vb.com , password – admin.
#####3.	Admin will log into the system and manage organizations, manage access points of organizations and grant access to registered users.
#####4.	Registered use mobile device to login into the system using login credentials and generated QR code will be displayed on the mobile screen.
####5.	User will scan the QR code and system will validate user access and display the status on the screen.
