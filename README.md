# Virtual-Badge
This is `Virtual Badge` app as college project for `CMPE 272` made by Prashant Yadav, Prashant Luthra, Akshay Talathi and Akshay Joshi. The basic idea of this project is to make a badging system by combining everyday usable devices with intelligent software, which can read QR code generated by the name and email-id of user.

The whole concept of it is to give user valid access by scanning QR code generated by system after user logins to the system. We are trying to give solution to the problems of physically carrying badges all around and redundancy in existing system with duplicate badges.
##URL of app-
(http://virtual-badge.mybluemix.net/)

We used Sencha Touch to develop mobile interface for login, where the user login using his credentials and he gets the QR code after successful login. The mobile app was hosted on XAMP server which was access over the internet on the phone.
Using Sencha touch we can develop rich HTML5 CSS3 rich client mobile application.
